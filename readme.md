# Project Title

 Analyse Future Threat And Mitigation Risk

## Technologies and architecture used 

The project architecture includes the darknet, an anonymity system to access the darknet, and the intelligence lifecycle to collect, process, and analyze data from the darknet. 

Firstly in the lifecycle, a web crawler for selecting a website from a set, downloading the web pages from the darknet, extracting the links contained within, and adding those links to the set of websites to visit. "Web Scraping with Python" further defines web scraping as extracting specific data from the websites.
 
Secondly in the lifecycle, big data as the storage and analysis of large and or complex data sets using a variety of techniques.

Thirdly in the lifecycle, "Natural Language Processing" work defines
NLP as a range of techniques for analyzing naturally occurring texts to achieve language
processing for a range of tasks.

Finally in the lifecycle, data mining is the extraction of knowledge from large-scale
data.

##  Code is designed for

For all the amazing technological innovations in the anonymity and privacy space, there is always a constant threat that has no effective technological patch - human error.

Whether it is operational security leaks or software misconfiguration - most often attacks on anonymity don't come from breaking the underlying systems, but from ourselves.

* Financial and Fraud: Leaked credit cards, IDs,reused passwords, and accounts give criminals an attach vector to financial accounts. The future analysis allows you to detect threats to institutions and customers. Being aware of such threats allows you better protect your business and customer.  
* It brings value to communities such as military, and law enforcement for tasks such as decision-making and finding current and future threats.
* Operators of hidden services find and fix operational security issues with their services such as Banks, government etc.
* Researchers and investigators monitor and track Dark Web sites


## Code was written in

Python


## Open source used

* [Ahmia](https://ahmia.fi/) - Search hidden services on the Tor network.
* [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/) - Big data as the storage.
* [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) - Toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
* [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) - User interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.
* [Maltego](www.maltego.com) - Data mining tool and create graphs for analyzing connections.


## Why it's cool

This application offers value in information security decision making through knowledge of threats and malicious activities that potentially impact business. Web crawling using the internet is common, however, using the darknet is less common for the typical cybersecurity analyst. The challenges to using the darknet for this application includes intelligence automation toolset that scans across the darknet - connecting, collecting, processing, and analyzing. Providing tools and processes serves as an on-ramp for cybersecurity intelligence analysts to search for threats.

## Deployment

Azure platform using Linux(Ubuntu)
